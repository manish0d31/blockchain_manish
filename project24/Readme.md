# Tokenized Real Estate

## Project Description
Tokenized Real Estate is a decentralized application (dApp) that enables fractional ownership of real estate properties through tokenized assets. The platform allows users to invest in real estate by purchasing tokens that represent a share of the property. Earnings from the property, such as rent or sale proceeds, are distributed proportionally to the token holders.

## Vision
The vision of Tokenized Real Estate is to democratize real estate investment by providing an accessible and transparent platform where users can invest in properties through fractional ownership. This aims to open the real estate market to a broader audience, allowing individuals to own a piece of real estate without large upfront capital investments.

## Key Features
- **Fractional Ownership**: Users can purchase tokens that represent a fraction of a real estate property, allowing multiple individuals to co-own the property.
- **Earnings Distribution**: Property earnings are distributed proportionally to token holders based on their ownership share.
- **Blockchain Security**: The platform leverages the Aptos blockchain to provide transparency, immutability, and secure transactions for ownership and earnings.

## Future Scope
- **Token Trading**: Implementation of a secondary market for trading property tokens between investors.
- **Property Transfer**: Enabling users to transfer property ownership by transferring tokens.
- **Advanced Earnings Calculation**: Enhancements to distribute earnings based on more complex ownership rules (e.g., different token classes, dynamic earnings rates).
- **Property Management**: Adding features for property management and expense tracking to reflect a more detailed financial model.
- **Multi-property Support**: Allowing users to invest in multiple properties with diversified earnings.
